# speech-therapist-ai
This repository contains a series of experiments and implementations related to speech therapy using AI. The goal is to test and addapt some LLM models to analyze and grade speech therapy exercise sessions. The project is in its early stages and is not yet ready for production use.

To run the code, you will need to install the required packages. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

It is algo recommended to create a `.env` with your LLM api keys (Gemini, Groq etc).

After installing the required packages, you can run each jupyter notebook in the `experiments` directory to see the experiments and results. The notebooks are organized by topic and contain explanations of the code and results.
